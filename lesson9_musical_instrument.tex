  \section{Overview}
    \subsection{Summary}
      The goal of this lesson is to introduce students to the technological nature of instruments,
       and how different instruments create the tones they do. 
    \subsection{Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Go over the basics of freqency and waves through an demonstration of vibrating strings
      \item (Intermediate) Show a wider variety of methods to generate sounds including tubes and pipes (used in trumpets), as well as lengths of metal (xyolophone) and drum sizes.
      \item (Advanced) Tie all instruments together about distances of travel, whether realted to string length or pipe length, or drum size.
      \item (Cooperative) Allow students to create their own instrument designs, then work with basic materials to build different tones. 

    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Key Vocabulary Terms}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item List some of the key takeaways from the lesson.  These are
        also good things to ask about at the conclusion of the lesson
      \item Pitch, Higher Pitch, Lower Pitch
      \item (Intermediate) Hertz, Frequency
      \item (Advanced) Period
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Materials}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Any materials needed, including the standard set of
          equipment
        \item Standard ev3 brick
        \item Laptops
        \item Programming Cables
        \item Smart phones with recordings of songs
        \item Demo Program: pop song played on the robot using sound
          blocks
      \end{itemize}
  \section{Procedure}
    \subsection{Setup (10 minutes)}
      Any special setup to do before the lesson begins
      \paragraph{}
      Nothing Special, setup robots and computers.
    \subsection{Introduction (5 minutes)}
      Introduce with a video of a musician that is recognizable to the
      students, prefering one that makes heavy use of synthesizers.
      Explain that the sounds are made by computers and that the robot
      is capable of making similar music (it's not entirely untrue).
      A way to get the students interested in the lesson.
    \subsection{Demonstration}
      Play the demo program, with sound blocks using the pitch
      setting.  Then show them how to make the notes 1, 2 and 3 of the
      major scale using the sound blocks, in addition to the wait
      block.  Make a program that plays the first 3 notes of "three
      blind mice", with the rest at the end, leave the notes on the
      projecter so the students know which frequencies to use.
    \subsection{Guided Practice}
      Play a recording of "Three blind mice" and have them try to
      synthesize it using the robots
      \subsubsection{sticking points:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Students can use the arrow keys to scroll the program
        \item It may be easier to work on parts of the song
          indiviually
        \item Make sure the robot is set to wait until completion
          before playing the next tone
        \item Copy and Paste is a good way to preserve the correct
          settings easily
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Extensions}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify parts of the song that loop, and put them in
          loops
        \item play "Mary had a little lamb", have the students find
          the right pitch for the fifth through experimentation
        \item When multiple groups have the song correctly made, have
          them play the program in a round
        \item Do the same challenge one octave up
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Conclusion and Evaluation}
      Give the kids a chance to show the music that they created
      \subsubsection{Exit Questions}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item How does freqency affect the pitch of a tone?
      \end{itemize}
